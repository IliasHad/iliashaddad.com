In the seventh article, As requested, I'll be talking about how to set up a local shopify theme development environment.

Let's go!

To create unlimited Shopify stores for development, you can create a Shopify Partner account using [this link](https://www.shopify.com/partners)

## Install ThemeKit

ThemeKit is the Offical Shopify tool to work with Shopify themes locally

```jsx
brew tap shopify/shopify

brew install themekit
```

Windows Chocolatey Installation

```jsx
choco install themekit
```

Linux Installation

```jsx
curl -s [<https://shopify.github.io/themekit/scripts/install.py>](<https://shopify.github.io/themekit/scripts/install.py>) | sudo python
```

## Create Private Shopify App

* Copy the Password

Configure ThemeKit

- Go **Online Store > Themes** and click on edit code for the Shopify theme you want to work with locally
- In the URL bar, you'll have the Shopify theme ID like this one [https://ilias-demo.myshopify.com/admin/themes/](https://ilias-demo.myshopify.com/admin/themes/)ID

Create a directory for this theme

Run this command to download your theme code

```jsx
theme get -p=your-password -s=[you-store.myshopify.com](<http://you-store.myshopify.com/>) -t=your-theme-id
```

and run this command to watch for file changes and upload them automatically to your remote Shopify theme

```jsx
theme watch
```

It's recommend to have config file, to prevent from overwiring the config/settings_data.json file that have the Shopify theme data like Shopify sections content or have different environement

```
development:
  password: Password
  theme_id: theme_id
  store: example.myshopify.com
  ignore_files:
    - config/settings_data.json
production:
  password: Password
  theme_id: theme_id
  store: example.myshopify.com
test:
  password: Password
  theme_id: theme_id
  store: example.myshopify.com
```
