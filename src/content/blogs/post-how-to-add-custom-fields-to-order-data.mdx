Note: I'm using the Debut theme, you may have different architecture

## Create a product template

- First, we need to create a custom product Shopify template and called product-custom.liquid
  ![ How to add custom fields to the order data in the product page](../../images/how-to-add-custom-fields-to-order-data-in-product-page-1.png)

- Create a new Shopify section and called product-custom-template and paste the code from the product-template section

- On the product page , change the template suffix to the product.custom

- Paste the code before <button type="submit"

Now, you can test it by adding the product to the cart and add the custom field value and process the checkout.

Et voila, the custom field value appear on the checkout page and order page
