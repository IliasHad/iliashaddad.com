On the 16th of the #4WeeksOfShopifyDev challenge, I’ll be talking Why you should convert your Shopify store to PWA for better performances?

### What is a PWA?

A progressive web application or PWA is a web application that has many capabilities of a native mobile app like Offline Mode, push notifications, have your website in your visitor home screen.

PWA need two files:

- Manifest: a JSON file that hosts your PWA configuration like App name, background color, splash screen…
- Service worker: is a script that your browser runs in the background to cache assets for offline experience and makes your site faster doing [predictive prefetching](https://web.dev/precache-with-workbox/)

### Why you should convert a Shopify store to PWA?

Every Store owner, should focus on improving their store performance, and with the new Shopify release. You can check your store speed in your theme dashboard based on your previous visitor's performance score.

In [my first article](https://iliashaddad.com/blog/shopify-speed-optimization-step-by-step-guide/) related to Shopify speed optimization, I got a lot of feedback and request from Shopify store owners to improve their online store speed.

From my experience with Shopify, Static files like images and JS files are the critical files that impact Shopify store performance.

We need to focus more on service workers because this what will make your website faster.
