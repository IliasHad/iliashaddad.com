After launching the beta version of Habitscript and getting great feedback about the idea and I‚Äôm still working on launching the v1 soon this month.

### Finding The¬†Idea

While building habitscript, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZeO0IQaJ-A&t=320s) from Devon Crawford about automating his process of video editing using FFmpeg and I already watch a lot of speed coding videos¬†,also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN144KdOIGM) about the journey of Pieter Levels while building Hoodmaps and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtsNNXpXcYs) about the journey of [Guilherme Rizzo](https://medium.com/u/2be928152fca) while building CSS Scan and I got excited about documenting my journey in a timelapse video

### Building The¬†Product

Indie hackers members recommend using what I already when I built Habitscript and it‚Äôs will save a lot of time. You need to use tools and programming language you already knew and familiar it.

I already have some experience in Node js, so I decided to use an electron which I can build a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux desktop app with same code) desktop app.

After about 5 days I built makerlapse and its‚Äô run correclty like I want to be

### What I learned after building makerlapse

*   **Build an electron app**: I watched some tutorials videos on youtube and I read some medium articles about building an electron app
*   **Build something simple and useful:** Don‚Äôt spend a lot of times building a feature that isn‚Äôt necessary
*   **Build a landing page before launching on ProductHunt.** When I launched habitscript and makerlapse I didn‚Äôt spend time on building a landing page and I lose a lot of visitors (potential paying customers) from producthunt

### **After Launching Makerlapse on ProductHunt¬†:**

*   **I got 127 upvotes on ProductHunt and it‚Äôs amazing**

### Mistakes I make while lancing on ProductHunt

*   I don‚Äôt spend time on building a landing page and newsletter and I lose a lot of potential paying customers and redirect all visitors to gumroad product page
*   I don‚Äôt spend time on designing a featured image ( The first image on product hunt media gallery and image used when your share producthunt link on social media
