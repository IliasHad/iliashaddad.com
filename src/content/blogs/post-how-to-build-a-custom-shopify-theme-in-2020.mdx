In the fifth article of the #4weeksOfShopifyDev challenge, I'll be talking about how to build a custom Shopify theme in 2020

### What is a Shopify theme?

Shopify theme is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code with liquid language which is a Shopify template language that adds dynamic to your HTML code on the server-side

### Shopify theme architecture

In a Shopify theme, we have several folders with specific files

- Config folder which contains:
  - settings_schema.json: Shopify themes global settings like font-family, primary color, and many other settings
  - settings_data.json: a registry file of what you have done in the Shopify theme editor
- Layout folder which contains:
  - theme.liquid: all other templates are rendered inside this file and contain a static section like header and footer
  - password.liquid: a template for password-protected Shopify store
  - gift.liquid: a template renders the gift card issued to a customer upon purchase.
- Templates folder which contains:
  - product.liquid: a template renders the product page
  - page.liquid: a template renders a Shopify page
  - cart.liquid: a template renders the cart page
  - customers/account.liquid: a template renders the account page
  - customers/order.liquid: a template renders a specific order content
  - customers/register.liquid: a template renders the create account page
  - customers/login.liquid: a template renders the login page
  - customers/reset_password.liquid: a template renders the reset password page
  - and other templates
- Assets folder which contains the CSS, JS, SVG files and images
- Snippets folder which contains reusable code (components)
- Sections folder which contains files to have a dynamic section in templates with data from Shopify theme editor

### Local Shopify theme development

To create a custom Shopify theme and from my research, you have 3 options

- Shopify Theme Kit with webpack:

You can write your webpack config that fit your needs and upload your theme files using themekit. for example, you can use [this repo](https://github.com/hayes0724/shopify-webpack-themekit) as a starting point or for inspiration

- Shopify Slate v1:

Even with Shopify ends support for Slate in January 2020. it still a great tool with great features out of the box like code splitting over templates and sections.

With the launch of the new Shopify architecture, Shopify is planning to launch also a developer tool to work with this architecture

If you want to start with Slate, you can use this [starter-theme](https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme) with Shopify slate folders architecture

- [The taproom build process](https://github.com/the-taproom/build-process):

The taproom is a well known Shopify dev agency and I found their tool through a Shopify dev twitch Livestream. I think this tool will be very helpful for new Shopify theme developers because this tool used by Taproom themself in building custom Shopify themes

### Ressource and tools to use

- [Shopify Liquid Code Examples](https://shopify.github.io/liquid-code-examples/)—A searchable library of code examples based around theme components that can be added directly into themes, to allow you to build and customize themes faster and more reliably.

- [The Shopify Liquid Docs](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/types/): The go-to resource for learning Shopify liquid language
- [Official Shopify Twitch Channel:](https://www.twitch.tv/shopifydevs) I found many tips and tools through Shopify live streams
