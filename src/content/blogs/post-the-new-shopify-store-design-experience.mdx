In the eighth article of #4WeeksOfShopifyDev challenge, I'll my review about the new Shopify store design experience review

in Shopify Unite 2019, Shopify launches the new Shopify store for Shopify partners to test out this new experience and give feedback about it to improve it over time.

### Sections Everywhere

- Add, remove and rearrange sections through Shopify theme editor on all pages and not the only home page

### Master Pages

- The master page is like the template in the previous architecture but with these new updates, you can have a master product page for all products with product info and you can add or change dynamic section for each product page without the need for custom alternate templates
- You can change sections for each product page and have different sections for each product using only Shopify theme editor without the need for custom alternate templates
