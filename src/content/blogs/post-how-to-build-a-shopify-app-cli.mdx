In the ninth article of #4weeksOfShopifydev challenge, I'll be talking about how to create a Shopify app using Shopify app cli.

### Why should you use Shopify App CLI?

- Create a new Private or Public app in a couple of seconds
- Update redirect URL and App URL automatically with ngrok server URL
- Have a ready to test a Shopify app with a free remote server (Ngrok)
- You have two starting apps, one built with Node js and the other one with Ruby on rails

### Install Shopify App CLI and create your first Shopify app

- [Install the Shopify App CLI.](https://shopify.github.io/shopify-app-cli/getting-started/install/)
- Create an app

```
shopify create
```

- Start and install your app on a Shopify development store

```
shopify serve
```

```
shopify open
```

I recommend starting with this tutorial [https://shopify.dev/tutorials/build-a-shopify-app-with-node-and-react](https://shopify.dev/tutorials/build-a-shopify-app-with-node-and-react) if you're already familiar with Node, React JS and GraphQl
