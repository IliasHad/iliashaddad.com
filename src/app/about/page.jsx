        <p>
          I&apos;m an experienced and self-taught software engineer with more
          than 3 years of experience in full-stack dev. I&apos;ve been working with
          the most popular front-end frameworks(Vue and React), and NodeJs on
          the backend.

            I&apos;m also a Shopify developer. I help Shopify store owners and
            clients with their technical needs (custom Shopify theme dev, custom
            Shopify app dev and speed optimization).

            I love mountain biking, especially long trips where I can visit new
            places! If you need a new custom-made website, a unique Shopify
            store or app, have an idea of an engaging web application: Please
            feel free to contact me and we&apos;ll talk about the details!
